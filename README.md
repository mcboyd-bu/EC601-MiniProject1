## Product Mission

Provide Netflix show creators/producers, and the watching public, Tweet sentiment about Netflix original content around the content release date.
Version 1 of our product will only include information about a select list of shows and seasons. 

## User Stories

1. I, as Netfix, would like to know how excited the public is for an upcoming original show based on Tweet sentiment about its Handle or Hashtag in a range from X->Y (TBD) as an average of a random selection of 20 daily Tweets over 10 days before the show release

2. I, as Netflix, would like to know how much the public enjoyed an original show based on Tweet sentiment after the show is released in a range from X->Y (TBD) as an average of a random selection of 20 daily Tweets over 10 days after the show is released

3. I, as a Netflix watcher, would like to know how a Netflix original show is perceived based on Tweet sentiment as either "Thumbs Up" or "Thumbs Down" before I watch it (based on an average of a random selection of 20 daily Tweets over 10 days after the show is released)
