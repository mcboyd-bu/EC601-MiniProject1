Team 3 - Matthew Boyd, Chenhui "Elvis" Zhu

## Product Mission

Provide Netflix show creators/producers, and the watching public, Tweet sentiment about current Netflix original content.
Version 1 of our product will only include information about a select list of shows and seasons.
Version 1 will also prompt for user type on initial execution; final product would have separate entry points for the 2 types of users.

## User Stories

1. I, as Netflix, would like to know recent ("current") public sentiment about an original show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from X-Y as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.

2. I, as a Netflix watcher, would like to know current public rating about an original Netflix show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from 1 star (bad) to 5 stars (really good) as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.
