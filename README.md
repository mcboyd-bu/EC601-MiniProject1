## Product Mission

Provide Netflix show creators/producers, and the watching public, Tweet sentiment about current Netflix original content.
* Version 1 of our product will only include information about a select list of shows and seasons.
* Version 1 will also prompt for user type on initial execution; final product would have separate entry points for the 2 types of users.

## User Stories

1. I, as Netflix, would like to know recent ("current") public sentiment about an original show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from 1-100 as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.

2. I, as a Netflix watcher, would like to know current public rating for an original Netflix show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from 1 star (bad) to 5 stars (really good) as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.

## Architecture Needed

* Python code running on computer with Internet access.

* At this time no persistent local (file) or external (servers, databases, etc.) resources will be used.

## Run Program

*Assumes __Google Natural Language API__ and __Tweepy__ packages already installed.*
*Assumes __Twitter API Security Keys__ available and __Google NLAPI JSON file__ available.*

1. Copy code locally
2. Ensure the following Python packages are installed: Google Natural Language API and Tweepy
3. Add Twitter API credentials to local "twitter_api.py" file and save
4. Open terminal/command window and navigate to folder where code was downloaded
5. Run platform-specific command to point program to Google NLAPI JSON file
6. Run "python Main.py"
7. Enter "user type" as prompted (cannot change this without restarting program)
8. Enter show "@" handle or "#" hashtag

## Test Case 

1.	For Netflix watcher.
I, as a Netflix watcher, want to know whether the Netflix new show called stranger thing is worth watching. I would like to use the product to know the current public rating for the show based on the Tweet sentiment in a range from 1 star to 5 stars.

2.	For Netflix:
I, as Netflix, intent to see the public rating for the latest show called Top Boy based on the Tweet sentiment in range of 1-100. This rating system helps me get public reflects faster and more efficient.


## Lessons Learned

In this mini project, I worked with my teammate Matthew who is really a good and helpful guy and I learnt how to use twitter API and google API to get tweets and analyze the sentiment of the messages. I was response for the twitter API and I also designed the calculation and rating system for the product. Our product performs very well in the test and can output proper grades for different kinds of users. We could have done this project better and faster. During the project, we changed our projectâ€™s MVP for many times, which was caused by the insufficiently background research. This experience helps me realize the significance of previous research. For the future project, I should spend more time on the background information research which can determine the outline of the project
