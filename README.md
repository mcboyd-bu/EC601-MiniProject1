## Product Mission

Provide Netflix show creators/producers, and the watching public, Tweet sentiment about Netflix original content around the content release date.
Version 1 of our product will only include information about a select list of shows and seasons. 

## User Stories

1. I, as Netflix, would like to know recent ("current") public sentiment about an original show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from X-Y as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.

2. I, as a Netflix watcher, would like to know current public rating about an original Netflix show based on Tweet sentiment in a range from 1 star (bad) to 5 stars (really good) as an average of 100 mixed (recent and popular) Tweets.

## Architecture Needed

* Basically python code running on one of our laptops with Internet access.

* At this time no persistent external resources (servers, databases, etc.) will be used.
